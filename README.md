# My Smart Vocabulary Trainer

## A user-driven vocabulary trainer


Being a non-native English speaker living in an English speaking
country I want *My Smart Vocabulary Trainer* to help the user learn words and phrases that they use on a day-to-day basis.
  
**What can you do with** ***My Smart Vocabulary Trainer*** **?**
-  create a database of words and phrases with your own interpretation  
-  enrich it with comments and example sentences
-  test yourself on your knowledge 
-  track your learning progress 

**Who can use it?**

*My Smart Vocabulary Trainer* is for anyone who wants to level up their 
language game. The design follows the principles of direct applicability, meaning that it allows you apply what you learn, and
learning what you need, meaning that you're prompted to learn something that you actually need in your daily life.
It is therefore **user-driven** in its application, **pragmatic** in its approach, and **perfect** for any skill-level.
